## Table of Contents

<!-- TODO: Generate or update the table of contents after the document structure is final. -->

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

<!-- TODO: State why testing is being performed, what confidence or decision the testing must support, and who will use the results. -->

### System Under Test

<!-- TODO: Identify the software system, subsystem, build, release, feature set, interfaces, or increment covered by this plan. -->

### Test Basis

<!-- TODO: Identify the requirements, architecture, design, risk analysis, standards, acceptance criteria, defect history, or other artifacts from which tests are derived. Link to requirements.md, architecture.md, and design.md as applicable. -->

## Test Objectives

<!-- TODO: State the specific objectives of testing, such as demonstrating requirement satisfaction, detecting faults, assessing quality attributes, preventing regression, evaluating risk, or supporting acceptance. -->

## Test Scope

### Features to Be Tested

<!-- TODO: List features, requirements, interfaces, workflows, quality attributes, or risks included in the test scope. -->

### Features Not to Be Tested

<!-- TODO: Identify explicitly excluded features or test types and explain why they are outside this plan. -->

### Test Assumptions and Constraints

<!-- TODO: State assumptions, environmental constraints, unavailable dependencies, data limitations, schedule limits, or other factors that shape the testing approach. -->

## Test Strategy

### Test Levels

<!-- TODO: Identify applicable levels such as unit, integration, system, acceptance, regression, or maintenance testing. State the objective and owner of each level. -->

| Test Level | Objective | Scope | Responsible Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<level>` | `<objective>` | `<scope>` | `<role>` |

### Test Types

<!-- TODO: Identify applicable functional and nonfunctional test types such as functional, boundary, negative, interface, usability, accessibility, performance, load, reliability, recovery, compatibility, security, installation, or configuration testing. -->

### Test Techniques

<!-- TODO: Identify specification-based, structure-based, experience-based, fault-based, risk-based, scenario-based, property-based, mutation, fuzzing, or other techniques and explain where each will be used. -->

### Test Prioritization

<!-- TODO: Explain how tests will be prioritized based on risk, criticality, change frequency, requirements priority, defect history, coverage, or another defensible basis. -->

## Requirements Traceability

<!-- TODO: Map requirements and other test objectives to planned test cases or automated tests. Every requirement that requires verification should have evidence. -->

| Requirement / Objective | Test ID(s) | Test Level / Type | Expected Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FR-001` | `TC-001` | `<level/type>` | `<result / log / report>` |

## Test Environment

### Hardware and Infrastructure

<!-- TODO: Identify physical or virtual hardware, devices, networks, containers, cloud resources, databases, services, or other infrastructure needed for testing. -->

### Software and Versions

<!-- TODO: Identify operating systems, runtimes, browsers, libraries, services, drivers, test frameworks, and versions. -->

### Environment Configuration

<!-- TODO: Identify configuration files, environment variables, feature flags, accounts, permissions, secrets handling, fixtures, mocks, or other setup needed to reproduce the test environment. -->

### Monitoring and Logging

<!-- TODO: Identify logs, metrics, traces, screenshots, recordings, profiler output, audit data, or other observability evidence to capture during testing. -->

## Test Data

### Test Data Requirements

<!-- TODO: Identify required normal, boundary, invalid, exceptional, synthetic, anonymized, production-like, or other test data. -->

### Test Data Preparation

<!-- TODO: Describe how test data will be created, loaded, reset, isolated, versioned, protected, and cleaned up. -->

### Sensitive or Regulated Test Data

<!-- TODO: State restrictions on personal, confidential, regulated, proprietary, or production data. Describe required anonymization, minimization, access, retention, and deletion. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

## Test Tools and Automation

<!-- TODO: Identify test frameworks, runners, coverage tools, mocking tools, API clients, performance tools, security scanners, CI workflows, reporting tools, or other automation. State what is automated and what remains manual. -->

## Test Case and Procedure Design

<!-- TODO: Define the required structure and naming of test cases. Detailed test cases may live in tests/, a test-management system, or a separate specification if the project warrants it. -->

| Test ID | Objective / Requirement | Preconditions | Inputs / Steps | Expected Result | Automation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TC-001` | `<FR-###>` | `<preconditions>` | `<inputs / procedure>` | `<expected outcome>` | `<yes/no/tool>` |

## Pass / Fail Criteria

### Test Case Pass Criteria

<!-- TODO: Define how an individual test case is determined to pass, fail, block, skip, or produce an inconclusive result. -->

### Test Suite Acceptance Criteria

<!-- TODO: Define acceptable test results at the suite or release level, including required critical tests, defect thresholds, coverage targets, performance thresholds, or other evidence. -->

## Entry, Suspension, Resumption, and Completion Criteria

### Entry Criteria

<!-- TODO: State the conditions that must be satisfied before a test level or test cycle begins. -->

### Suspension Criteria

<!-- TODO: Identify conditions under which testing must stop, such as unusable environments, blocking defects, invalid builds, unsafe conditions, or unreliable test data. -->

### Resumption Criteria

<!-- TODO: State what must be true before suspended testing can resume. -->

### Completion / Exit Criteria

<!-- TODO: Define when testing is sufficient to conclude the planned test activity, considering requirement satisfaction, risk, unresolved defects, coverage, reports, and stakeholder needs. -->

## Defect and Test-Incident Management

<!-- TODO: Define how unexpected results, failures, anomalies, blocked tests, environment problems, and defects will be recorded, triaged, reproduced, prioritized, resolved, retested, and closed. -->

## Regression and Retesting Strategy

<!-- TODO: Define when regression testing is required, which tests form the regression suite, how changed areas are selected, and how defect fixes are retested. -->

## Specialized Quality Testing

### Performance and Scalability Testing

<!-- TODO: Define workloads, benchmarks, thresholds, resource measurements, and environments for performance or scalability verification. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### Security Testing

<!-- TODO: Define security-focused testing such as authentication/authorization tests, misuse/abuse cases, dependency scans, static/dynamic analysis, fuzzing, vulnerability checks, or penetration testing within authorized course/project scope. -->

### Reliability, Recovery, and Resilience Testing

<!-- TODO: Define fault, restart, timeout, degraded-service, backup/restore, failover, or recovery scenarios. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### Usability and Accessibility Testing

<!-- TODO: Define user-centered, accessibility, compatibility, keyboard, screen-reader, or other usability/accessibility evaluation. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

## Roles and Responsibilities

<!-- TODO: Identify who plans, designs, implements, executes, monitors, reviews, approves, and reports testing. Address independence where relevant. -->

## Test Schedule and Milestones

<!-- TODO: Identify test-design deadlines, environment readiness, execution cycles, regression cycles, completion reviews, or other milestones. Delete this section if scheduling is managed elsewhere. -->

## Test Risks and Contingencies

<!-- TODO: Identify risks to the test effort or residual product risks that could affect confidence. State mitigations and contingency plans. -->

| Risk | Impact on Testing / Product | Mitigation | Contingency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<risk>` | `<impact>` | `<mitigation>` | `<contingency>` |

## Test Metrics and Reporting

<!-- TODO: Define meaningful measures such as specified/executed/passed/failed test counts, coverage, defect trends, defect detection, residual risk, performance results, or completion progress. State who receives reports and how often. -->

## Test Deliverables

<!-- TODO: List expected outputs such as this test plan, test cases/specifications, automated tests, test data, environment configuration, execution logs, incident/defect reports, status reports, evidence, and test completion report. -->

## Test Evidence and Reproducibility

<!-- TODO: Define what must be recorded so another person can reproduce important test results, including software version/commit, environment, configuration, data, procedure, actual result, expected result, date/time, and tester or automated workflow. -->

## Approval and Release Recommendation

<!-- TODO: Identify who reviews test completion and what evidence supports a release, acceptance, grading, or no-release recommendation. -->

## Open Issues

<!-- TODO: Record unresolved test-design questions, environment gaps, missing data, known blockers, or decisions still required. -->

## References

<!-- TODO: List external sources, standards, frameworks, libraries, documentation, or other references used to develop this document. Use the citation style required by the course. Delete this section if references are not required. -->
