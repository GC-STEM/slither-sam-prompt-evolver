# {{IT-140}} {{Task Code}} | Software Requirements Specification

<!-- TODO: Replace the title placeholders with the course code, task code, and task title. -->

This **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** defines what the software must do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the criteria used to determine whether the completed solution satisfies stakeholder needs.
<!-- omit from toc -->
## Table of Contents

<!-- TODO: Generate or update the table of contents after the document structure is final. -->

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

<!-- TODO: State why this SRS exists, what decision or development work it supports, and who will use it. -->

### Product Scope

<!-- TODO: Define the software product, subsystem, feature, or increment covered by this SRS. State the business, academic, scientific, or technical problem the software will address. -->

### Intended Audience

<!-- TODO: Identify the intended readers, such as developers, testers, maintainers, instructors, clients, users, or other stakeholders. -->

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

<!-- TODO: Define domain terms, abbreviations, acronyms, and technical vocabulary needed to interpret the requirements consistently. Delete this subsection if none are needed. -->

## Product Context

### Problem Statement

<!-- TODO: Describe the problem or opportunity in stakeholder terms. Focus on the need to be satisfied, not on the implementation. -->

### Product Perspective

<!-- TODO: Explain whether the software is new, replaces or extends an existing system, is part of a larger system, or depends on an existing platform or service. -->

### Stakeholders and User Classes

<!-- TODO: Identify stakeholder groups and user classes. For each, summarize relevant goals, responsibilities, technical experience, access needs, or other characteristics that affect requirements. -->

| Stakeholder or User Class | Goals / Needs | Relevant Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<name or role>` | `<what this stakeholder needs>` | `<constraints, expertise, accessibility needs, etc.>` |

### Operating Environment

<!-- TODO: Identify required or expected operating systems, hardware, browsers, runtimes, cloud services, networks, devices, databases, or other execution environments. -->

### Assumptions and Dependencies

<!-- TODO: State assumptions that must remain true and external dependencies that may affect the requirements or successful operation of the software. -->

### Scope Boundaries

#### In Scope

<!-- TODO: List capabilities and responsibilities included in this project or increment. -->

#### Out of Scope

<!-- TODO: List related capabilities intentionally excluded, deferred, or owned by another system. -->

## Functional Requirements

<!-- TODO: Define observable behaviors the software must provide. Give every requirement a unique, stable identifier. Write requirements so they are necessary, unambiguous, feasible, and verifiable. Prefer one requirement per row. -->

| ID | Requirement | Rationale / Source | Priority | Acceptance Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FR-001` | `The software shall ...` | `<why / source>` | `<Must / Should / Could>` | `<how satisfaction can be demonstrated>` |

### Use Cases or User Stories

<!-- TODO: Add use cases, user stories, scenarios, or workflows when they clarify functional requirements. Trace each item to one or more requirement IDs. Delete this subsection if another representation is more appropriate. -->

## Data Requirements

### Inputs

<!-- TODO: Identify externally supplied data, including source, type/format, valid range, required/optional status, validation rules, and handling of invalid input. -->

| Input | Source | Type / Format | Validation / Constraints | Related Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<input>` | `<source>` | `<type>` | `<rules>` | `<FR-###>` |

### Outputs

<!-- TODO: Identify required outputs, including destination, format, precision, ordering, presentation, or other acceptance constraints. -->

| Output | Destination | Type / Format | Required Characteristics | Related Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<output>` | `<destination>` | `<type>` | `<rules>` | `<FR-###>` |

### Persistent Data

<!-- TODO: Identify data that must be stored beyond a single execution or request. Specify retention, integrity, consistency, lifecycle, backup, archival, or deletion requirements as applicable. -->

### Data Privacy and Sensitivity

<!-- TODO: Identify personal, confidential, regulated, proprietary, biometric, authentication, or other sensitive data. State handling, minimization, access, retention, and deletion requirements. -->

## External Interface Requirements

### User Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Specify required user-interface behaviors, workflows, accessibility expectations, supported interaction modes, or constraints. Reference wireframes or prototypes when available. -->

### Software Interfaces and APIs

<!-- TODO: Identify external software, APIs, services, libraries, databases, file formats, or protocols with which the software must interact. Specify required versions or contracts when relevant. -->

### Hardware and Device Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Identify hardware, sensors, actuators, peripherals, embedded devices, or other physical interfaces. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### Communication Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Identify network protocols, ports, message formats, authentication methods, timing constraints, or other communication requirements. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

## Nonfunctional Requirements

<!-- TODO: Give each nonfunctional requirement a unique identifier such as NFR-001. State measurable targets whenever practical. -->

### Performance and Efficiency

<!-- TODO: Specify response time, latency, throughput, resource utilization, capacity, or efficiency requirements. -->

### Reliability, Availability, and Recoverability

<!-- TODO: Specify availability, fault tolerance, recovery, backup, continuity, durability, or reliability requirements. -->

### Security

<!-- TODO: Specify authentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity, secure defaults, input protection, secrets handling, dependency security, logging, or other security requirements. -->

### Privacy

<!-- TODO: Specify privacy requirements distinct from general security, including data minimization, purpose limitation, consent, retention, deletion, and access controls when applicable. -->

### Usability and Accessibility

<!-- TODO: Specify usability, learnability, accessibility, localization, or human-interface requirements. Identify applicable accessibility standards when required. -->

### Maintainability and Supportability

<!-- TODO: Specify modularity, readability, diagnosability, logging, documentation, testability, configurability, update, or support requirements. -->

### Portability, Compatibility, and Interoperability

<!-- TODO: Specify supported platforms, migration expectations, browser/device compatibility, backward compatibility, standards conformance, or interoperability requirements. -->

### Scalability

<!-- TODO: Specify expected growth in users, transactions, records, data volume, workload, nodes, or other scaling dimensions. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

## Technology and Implementation Constraints

<!-- TODO: List mandated or prohibited technologies, languages, frameworks, libraries, versions, platforms, tools, deployment environments, licensing constraints, or implementation restrictions. Do not put preferences here unless they are true constraints. -->

## Legal, Regulatory, Policy, and Ethical Constraints

<!-- TODO: Identify laws, regulations, institutional policies, contractual obligations, licenses, professional standards, safety expectations, or ethical constraints that materially affect the software. Delete this section if none apply. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- TODO: State project- or feature-level criteria that determine whether the software is acceptable for release, demonstration, grading, or stakeholder approval. Keep detailed test procedures in test_plan.md or the test suite. -->

## Requirements Traceability

<!-- TODO: Trace requirements to their source and to downstream architecture, design, implementation, and verification artifacts. Add columns as needed for the project. -->

| Requirement ID | Source | Architecture / Design | Implementation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FR-001` | `<source>` | `<section / decision>` | `<module / file>` | `<test ID>` |

## Requirement Priorities and Release Allocation

<!-- TODO: Identify which requirements belong to the current release or increment and which are deferred. Explain the prioritization approach if it is not obvious. -->

## Risks, Conflicts, and Open Issues

<!-- TODO: Record unresolved requirement conflicts, ambiguities, dependencies, feasibility concerns, or decisions that could materially affect downstream work. Include an owner or resolution plan when appropriate. -->

| ID | Issue / Risk | Impact | Owner | Status / Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REQ-ISSUE-001` | `<description>` | `<impact>` | `<owner>` | `<status>` |

## References

<!-- TODO: List external sources, standards, frameworks, libraries, documentation, or other references used to develop this document. Use the citation style required by the course. Delete this section if references are not required. -->
