# {{IT-140}} {{Task Code}} | Software Design Description

<!-- TODO: Replace the title placeholders with the course code, task code, and task title. -->

This **Software Design Description (SDD)** transforms the approved requirements and architecture into an implementable design. It specifies the internal organization, interfaces, data structures, algorithms, control logic, and design decisions needed to construct and verify the software.

## Table of Contents

<!-- TODO: Generate or update the table of contents after the document structure is final. -->

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

<!-- TODO: State the purpose of this design and how it will guide construction, verification, maintenance, or future change. -->

### Design Scope

<!-- TODO: Identify the system, subsystem, feature, module set, or increment covered by this design. -->

### Design Inputs

<!-- TODO: Identify the requirements, architecture, standards, constraints, prototypes, existing code, or other inputs that govern this design. Link to requirements.md and architecture.md when applicable. -->

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

<!-- TODO: Define design-specific vocabulary needed to interpret this document consistently. -->

## Design Overview

### Design Approach

<!-- TODO: Summarize the design strategy, decomposition approach, paradigm, patterns, or principles used. Explain how the design fits within architecture.md. -->

### Design Diagram

<!-- TODO: Link to [diagram.drawio](./diagram.drawio) or another diagram that communicates the design structure or behavior. State what the diagram represents and how it should be interpreted. -->

### Design Responsibilities

<!-- TODO: Summarize how required behavior is allocated among components, modules, classes, functions, services, or other implementation units. -->

## Component and Module Design

<!-- TODO: Document each major component or module at sufficient detail for implementation. Repeat the following subsection as needed. -->

### `<Component or Module Name>`

#### Purpose and Responsibilities

<!-- TODO: State what this unit does and which requirements or architectural responsibilities it realizes. -->

#### Public Interface

<!-- TODO: Specify callable operations, commands, events, messages, endpoints, parameters, return values, preconditions, postconditions, and externally visible behavior. -->

#### Internal Structure

<!-- TODO: Describe internal classes, functions, submodules, collaborators, state, and important relationships. -->

#### Dependencies

<!-- TODO: Identify internal and external dependencies and explain how they are used. -->

#### Algorithms and Logic

<!-- TODO: Describe or reference the algorithms and control logic. Link to [pseudocode.i2p](./pseudocode.i2p) or additional pseudocode files where useful. -->

#### Data Used or Produced

<!-- TODO: Identify data structures, persistent data, messages, files, or other data this unit reads, writes, owns, or transforms. -->

#### Error and Exception Behavior

<!-- TODO: Describe anticipated error conditions, validation failures, exceptions, retry behavior, fallbacks, or recovery expectations for this unit. -->

## Data Design

### Domain Model

<!-- TODO: Describe the important domain entities, value objects, relationships, invariants, and ownership rules. Include or reference a UML class diagram or ER diagram when appropriate. -->

### Data Structures

<!-- TODO: Specify important in-memory structures, collections, schemas, types, fields, constraints, and representations. -->

### Persistent Storage

<!-- TODO: Specify files, databases, schemas, tables, collections, object stores, caches, or other persistent storage. Describe keys, relationships, integrity constraints, indexing, retention, and migration considerations as applicable. -->

### Data Flow and Transformation

<!-- TODO: Describe how data enters the software, moves among components, is transformed, validated, persisted, and leaves the software. -->

## Interface Design

### User Interface Design

<!-- TODO: Describe user workflows, screens/views, navigation, inputs, outputs, validation, feedback, accessibility behavior, and error states. Link to wireframes or prototypes if available. -->

### API and Service Interface Design

<!-- TODO: Specify endpoints, operations, messages, schemas, parameters, responses, error contracts, authentication, versioning, and compatibility expectations. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### File and Data Exchange Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Specify file formats, serialization, import/export behavior, encodings, schemas, or exchange conventions. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### Hardware / Device Interface Design

<!-- TODO: Specify device commands, sensor/actuator interactions, timing, protocols, or hardware-specific behaviors. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

## Control and Behavioral Design

### Main Processing Flow

<!-- TODO: Describe the principal sequence of operations from start to completion. Reference pseudocode, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, flowcharts, or state diagrams as appropriate. -->

### State and Mode Behavior

<!-- TODO: Identify states, modes, valid transitions, triggers, guards, and actions. Delete this subsection if the software is effectively stateless. -->

### Event Handling

<!-- TODO: Describe events, callbacks, handlers, subscriptions, interrupts, messages, or asynchronous triggers and how the software responds. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### Concurrency and Synchronization

<!-- TODO: Describe processes, threads, tasks, asynchronous operations, shared resources, locking, atomicity, race-condition prevention, scheduling, or coordination. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

## Error Handling, Fault Tolerance, and Recovery

<!-- TODO: Define system-wide strategies for input errors, exceptional conditions, partial failures, retries, timeouts, rollback, recovery, graceful degradation, cleanup, and user-facing error reporting. -->

## Security and Privacy Design

<!-- TODO: Explain how security and privacy requirements are realized in the detailed design, including validation, authentication, authorization, data protection, secrets, logging, safe failure, secure defaults, and privacy controls. -->

## Logging, Monitoring, and Diagnostics

<!-- TODO: Define logs, events, metrics, traces, health checks, diagnostic output, audit records, or other observability mechanisms required to support testing, troubleshooting, operations, or maintenance. -->

## Configuration and Environment Design

<!-- TODO: Identify configurable values, environment variables, configuration files, feature flags, secrets, environment-specific settings, and safe defaults. State what must not be hard-coded. -->

## Performance and Resource Design

<!-- TODO: Describe design choices related to time complexity, space complexity, latency, throughput, memory, CPU, I/O, network use, caching, batching, or other resource constraints. -->

## Design Patterns and Reuse

<!-- TODO: Identify patterns, reusable components, frameworks, libraries, or prior assets used in the design. Explain where they apply and why they are appropriate. -->

## Design Decisions and Rationale

<!-- TODO: Record significant detailed-design decisions, alternatives, assumptions, and trade-offs. Keep architecture-level decisions in architecture.md. -->

| ID | Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale / Trade-offs | Related Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DD-001` | `<decision>` | `<alternatives>` | `<why>` | `<FR/NFR-###>` |

## Design Verification and Traceability

<!-- TODO: Demonstrate that the design covers applicable requirements and conforms to architecture.md. Identify how major design elements will be verified by review, static analysis, unit tests, integration tests, or other evidence. -->

| Requirement / Architecture Driver | Design Element | Verification Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<FR/NFR/ADR ID>` | `<component / section>` | `<review / test / analysis>` |

## Open Issues and Deferred Design Work

<!-- TODO: Record unresolved design questions, intentionally deferred details, or construction-time decisions. Assign owners or resolution triggers where useful. -->

## References

<!-- TODO: List external sources, standards, frameworks, libraries, documentation, or other references used to develop this document. Use the citation style required by the course. Delete this section if references are not required. -->
