# {{IT-140}} {{Task Code}} | Software Architecture Description

<!-- TODO: Replace the title placeholders with the course code, task code, and task title. -->

This **Software Architecture Description (SAD)** documents the fundamental organization of the software, its major elements and relationships, the architectural decisions that constrain detailed design and construction, and the rationale for those decisions.

## Table of Contents

<!-- TODO: Generate or update the table of contents after the document structure is final. -->

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

<!-- TODO: State what architectural decisions this document records and how the document will guide design, construction, testing, deployment, operation, or maintenance. -->

### Architecture Scope

<!-- TODO: Identify the system, subsystem, product, feature set, or increment covered by this architecture. Clarify boundaries with external systems. -->

### Intended Audience

<!-- TODO: Identify readers such as developers, designers, testers, operators, maintainers, security reviewers, clients, or other stakeholders. -->

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

<!-- TODO: Define architecture-specific terminology needed to interpret this document consistently. -->

## Architecture Context

### Requirements and Architectural Drivers

<!-- TODO: Identify the architecturally significant requirements (ASRs), quality attributes, constraints, risks, and stakeholder concerns that drive major architectural decisions. Reference requirements.md by stable requirement ID. -->

| Driver / ASR | Source | Architectural Significance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<FR/NFR-###>` | `[requirements.md](./requirements.md)` | `<why this shapes the architecture>` |

### Stakeholders and Concerns

<!-- TODO: Identify stakeholder groups and the architectural concerns each needs this architecture to address. -->

| Stakeholder | Architectural Concerns | Relevant View(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<stakeholder>` | `<concerns>` | `<logical / deployment / etc.>` |

### System Context

<!-- TODO: Describe the software in its environment, including users, external systems, data sources, devices, networks, and trust boundaries. Reference diagram.drawio or another context diagram when useful. -->

### Assumptions and Constraints

<!-- TODO: Record assumptions and constraints that shape architectural choices, including platform, technology, schedule, regulatory, organizational, or legacy constraints. -->

## Architecture Overview

### Architectural Style or Pattern

<!-- TODO: Identify the primary architectural style(s), pattern(s), or computing paradigm(s), such as layered, client-server, event-driven, microservices, MVC, pipe-and-filter, or another justified approach. -->

### Major Architectural Elements

<!-- TODO: Identify the major components, services, subsystems, processes, or other architectural elements and their primary responsibilities. -->

| Element | Responsibility | Interfaces / Dependencies | Related Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<element>` | `<responsibility>` | `<interfaces>` | `<FR/NFR-###>` |

### Key Interactions

<!-- TODO: Summarize the most important interactions, message flows, request flows, event flows, or control relationships among architectural elements. -->

## Architecture Views

<!-- TODO: Include only views that address meaningful stakeholder concerns. Add diagrams to diagram.drawio or use additional clearly named diagram files when one file is insufficient. -->

### Logical / Capability View

<!-- TODO: Show the principal logical elements or domain capabilities and how they collaborate to satisfy functional requirements. -->

### Module / Development View

<!-- TODO: Show how the software is decomposed into implementation units, packages, modules, repositories, services, or layers and identify important dependencies among them. -->

### Component-and-Connector / Runtime View

<!-- TODO: Show runtime components, processes, services, connectors, protocols, message paths, or other runtime interactions. -->

### Information / Data View

<!-- TODO: Describe key information elements, ownership, storage, movement, transformation, consistency, and access patterns. Reference the detailed data design in design.md when appropriate. -->

### Process / Concurrency View

<!-- TODO: Describe processes, threads, asynchronous work, synchronization, scheduling, queues, events, or concurrency concerns. Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

### Deployment / Physical View

<!-- TODO: Map software elements to execution environments, nodes, containers, devices, cloud resources, networks, or other infrastructure. Identify environment-specific constraints. -->

### Scenario / Use-Case View

<!-- TODO: Use one or more important scenarios to demonstrate how architectural elements collaborate end-to-end. Prioritize architecturally significant, risky, or crosscutting scenarios. -->

## Interfaces and Integration

### External Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Identify major external systems, APIs, protocols, data exchanges, or integration boundaries and the responsibilities on each side of the boundary. -->

### Internal Architectural Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Define contracts among major architectural elements sufficiently to support independent design and implementation. -->

### Interoperability

<!-- TODO: Describe standards, formats, compatibility requirements, adapters, gateways, or other mechanisms used to interoperate with heterogeneous systems. -->

## Quality Attribute Strategies

### Performance and Scalability

<!-- TODO: Describe architectural tactics and trade-offs used to meet performance, capacity, throughput, latency, and scalability requirements. -->

### Reliability, Availability, and Recoverability

<!-- TODO: Describe architectural tactics for fault isolation, redundancy, retry, recovery, continuity, durability, backup, or graceful degradation. -->

### Security and Privacy

<!-- TODO: Describe trust boundaries, authentication, authorization, data protection, secrets, isolation, least privilege, attack-surface reduction, privacy boundaries, and other architectural security/privacy strategies. -->

### Maintainability, Modifiability, and Testability

<!-- TODO: Explain how the architecture supports change, modularity, observability, diagnosability, automated testing, replacement, or extension. -->

### Usability and Accessibility

<!-- TODO: Identify architecture-level implications for user experience or accessibility when they affect major system structure or technology choices. Delete this subsection if not architecturally significant. -->

## Technology Stack and Platform Decisions

<!-- TODO: Identify major languages, frameworks, runtimes, databases, infrastructure platforms, third-party services, and other technologies selected at the architecture level. Explain why each selection is appropriate. -->

## Dependencies and Supply-Chain Considerations

<!-- TODO: Identify architecturally significant internal and third-party dependencies. Record version constraints, licensing, trust, maintenance, security, vendor lock-in, or replacement concerns where material. -->

## Architectural Decisions and Rationale

<!-- TODO: Record nontrivial decisions. Include alternatives considered and why they were accepted or rejected. A separate ADR collection may be used instead for projects that require it. -->

| ID | Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale / Trade-offs | Consequences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ADR-001` | `<decision>` | `<alternatives>` | `<why>` | `<positive and negative consequences>` |

## Architecture Risks and Technical Debt

<!-- TODO: Identify architectural risks, known limitations, deferred decisions, intentional compromises, or technical debt. State likely consequences and mitigation or review triggers. -->

## Architecture Evaluation

<!-- TODO: Explain how the architecture has been or will be evaluated against its significant requirements and quality attributes. Examples include scenario review, prototype, proof of concept, performance model, security review, or architecture review. -->

## Traceability to Detailed Design and Testing

<!-- TODO: Show how architectural elements and decisions constrain or are realized by design.md and how significant architectural qualities will be verified in test_plan.md. -->

## Open Issues

<!-- TODO: List unresolved architectural questions that must be addressed before or during detailed design, construction, testing, or deployment. -->

## References

<!-- TODO: List external sources, standards, frameworks, libraries, documentation, or other references used to develop this document. Use the citation style required by the course. Delete this section if references are not required. -->
