# {{IT-140}} {{Task Code}} | Software Construction Plan

<!-- TODO: Replace the title placeholders with the course code, task code, and task title. -->

This **Software Construction Plan (SCP)** defines how the approved design will be implemented, integrated, verified during construction, and managed as working source code and related software artifacts.
<!-- omit from toc -->
## Table of Contents

<!-- TODO: Generate or update the table of contents after the document structure is final. -->

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

<!-- TODO: State what construction work this plan governs and how it will guide developers through implementation and integration. -->

### Construction Scope

<!-- TODO: Identify the system, subsystem, feature set, modules, or release increment covered by this plan. -->

### Construction Inputs

<!-- TODO: Identify the requirements, architecture, design, standards, interfaces, prototypes, or existing code that construction must follow. Link to requirements.md, architecture.md, and design.md as applicable. -->

## Construction Approach

### Development Method

<!-- TODO: Identify the construction approach, such as incremental, iterative, vertical-slice, feature-based, component-based, test-first, prototype-to-production, or another justified method. -->

### Construction Principles

<!-- TODO: State the principles that will guide implementation, such as minimizing complexity, readability, modularity, reuse, defensive programming, construction for verification, or incremental integration. -->

### Definition of Construction Complete

<!-- TODO: Define what must be true for a component or feature to be considered complete from a construction perspective. Distinguish this from overall project acceptance criteria. -->

## Development Environment

### Languages and Runtimes

<!-- TODO: Identify programming languages, runtime versions, compilers/interpreters, SDKs, and required platform versions. -->

### Development Tools

<!-- TODO: Identify required IDE/editor, version-control tools, package managers, linters, formatters, debuggers, profilers, static-analysis tools, diagramming/modeling tools, or other development tools. -->

### Environment Setup

<!-- TODO: Describe or link to reproducible setup steps, environment variables, local services, containers, virtual environments, or other prerequisites. -->

### Coding and Documentation Standards

<!-- TODO: Identify coding style guides, naming conventions, formatting, comments/docstrings, file organization, API documentation, and other construction standards. -->

## Source-Code Organization

<!-- TODO: Describe the intended repository/package/module structure. Explain the purpose of significant directories and how source files map to the design. -->

```text
src/
└── <package-or-module>/
```

## Work Breakdown and Construction Order

<!-- TODO: Define the order in which components, modules, features, or vertical slices will be constructed. Explain prerequisite relationships and why the sequence reduces risk or supports early verification. -->

| Order | Work Item | Dependencies / Prerequisites | Completion Evidence |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `<component / feature>` | `<dependency>` | `<tests / review / demo>` |

## Integration Strategy

<!-- TODO: Describe when and how separately constructed units will be combined. Identify incremental, phased, continuous, top-down, bottom-up, or other integration strategy and how integration risks will be controlled. -->

### Integration Order

<!-- TODO: Identify the planned order of integration and any stubs, mocks, adapters, simulators, test doubles, or temporary interfaces needed. -->

### Integration Verification

<!-- TODO: Identify the checks or tests that must pass as each increment is integrated. -->

## Version Control and Change Management

### Branching and Commit Practices

<!-- TODO: Define branch strategy, commit expectations, pull-request workflow, merge strategy, sign-off requirements, or other repository practices. -->

### Change Control

<!-- TODO: Explain how requirement, architecture, design, or implementation changes are proposed, reviewed, traced, and incorporated. -->

### Configuration Items

<!-- TODO: Identify source, configuration, schemas, generated files, build scripts, infrastructure definitions, tests, documentation, or other artifacts that require configuration management. -->

## Dependency and Supply-Chain Management

<!-- TODO: Identify required third-party packages, libraries, frameworks, services, or tool dependencies. State versioning, licensing, source/trust, vulnerability, update, and replacement expectations. -->

| Dependency | Version / Constraint | Purpose | License | Security / Maintenance Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<dependency>` | `<version>` | `<purpose>` | `<license>` | `<notes>` |

## Build and Packaging

<!-- TODO: Define how source code is transformed into executable, deployable, distributable, or demonstrable artifacts. Include build commands, generated artifacts, packaging, reproducibility, and cleanup expectations. Delete this section for projects with no meaningful build step. -->

## Construction Testing

### Unit Testing

<!-- TODO: Define what developers must unit-test during construction, the testing framework, expected isolation, naming/location conventions, and minimum acceptance expectations. -->

### Integration Testing

<!-- TODO: Define construction-time integration testing needed before handoff to broader system testing. -->

### Test-First / Test-Driven Practices

<!-- TODO: State whether tests are expected before, during, or after implementation and how this practice supports construction. Delete this subsection if not required. -->

## Code Review and Static Verification

<!-- TODO: Define peer review, pull-request review, linting, formatting, type checking, static analysis, security scanning, complexity checks, or other pre-merge verification. -->

## Security During Construction

<!-- TODO: Define secure coding expectations, secrets handling, input validation, dependency scanning, vulnerability remediation, least privilege, unsafe-feature restrictions, or other construction-specific security practices. -->

## Construction Quality Gates

<!-- TODO: Define measurable checks that must pass before code can be merged, integrated, released for testing, or considered construction-complete. -->

| Gate | Required Evidence | Failure Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<gate>` | `<evidence>` | `<what happens if it fails>` |

## Automation and Continuous Integration

<!-- TODO: Describe CI workflows, automated builds, tests, analysis, artifact generation, or other automated checks. Identify which checks run locally, on commit, on pull request, or on merge. -->

## Roles and Responsibilities

<!-- TODO: Assign responsibilities for implementation, review, integration, configuration management, build, security, documentation, and issue resolution. For an individual student project, identify which responsibilities remain with the student and which are provided by course infrastructure. -->

## Milestones and Schedule

<!-- TODO: Identify construction milestones, planned increments, integration points, demonstrations, code-complete dates, or other schedule checkpoints. Delete this section if scheduling is managed elsewhere. -->

## Construction Measures and Progress Tracking

<!-- TODO: Identify measures useful for managing construction, such as work-item completion, build status, code review status, test pass/fail counts, coverage, defect trends, complexity, or other project-appropriate indicators. Avoid vanity metrics. -->

## Construction Risks and Mitigations

<!-- TODO: Identify implementation, integration, dependency, tooling, staffing, schedule, security, or technical risks specific to construction and state mitigation or contingency actions. -->

| Risk | Likelihood / Impact | Mitigation | Trigger / Contingency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<risk>` | `<rating>` | `<mitigation>` | `<trigger>` |

## Construction Deliverables

<!-- TODO: List the source code, build artifacts, configuration, automated tests, documentation updates, generated artifacts, or other outputs expected from construction. -->

## Traceability and Handoff

<!-- TODO: Explain how constructed components trace to design and requirements, and what evidence or artifacts are handed off to system testing, deployment, operations, or maintenance. -->

## Open Issues

<!-- TODO: Record unresolved construction decisions, blockers, dependencies, or assumptions requiring follow-up. -->

## References

<!-- TODO: List external sources, standards, frameworks, libraries, documentation, or other references used to develop this document. Use the citation style required by the course. Delete this section if references are not required. -->
